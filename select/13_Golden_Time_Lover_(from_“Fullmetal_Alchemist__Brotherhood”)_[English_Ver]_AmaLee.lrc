[00:23.51] No more hesitating, but my body is shaking, not obeying
[00:27.25] Slowly decaying, and my self-control, it is breaking
[00:31.38] Even the sun and the moon
[00:32.63] I can't count on them, my luck is all spent
[00:35.16] But this isn't the end
[00:36.46] I'm repeating those words again and again
[00:56.96] 
[00:46.59] They're poor odds I'm facing
[00:47.82] But you won't catch me fleeing, I'm not leaving
[00:50.46] Don't need a reason
[00:51.57] I know the future's ahead, let's seize it
[01:12.07] 
[00:54.45] And it's a chance that I'm taking
[00:56.06] Eyes on the prize, I'm not holding back
[00:58.10] 'Cause the pride of winning is all you need
[01:19.60] 
[01:01.07] I wanna dine on the sweet wine of victory
[01:04.53] But we may only get the stale taste of defeat
[01:08.20] But it's fine either way, I'll take these threads of fate
[01:11.98] And I will create a new world of our own
[01:31.98] 
[01:17.25] Do or die, golden time, lover's gonna blow your mind
[01:20.93] Raise the stakes, poker face, give me all you got, here we go
[01:25.10] Yeah, I know those delusions will drag you into it
[01:50.10] 
[01:32.65] It's the same endless game, but somehow I'll find my way
[01:36.21] It's a fine borderline, but I'll walk it still, what's the price
[01:40.57] Won't think twice, I will pay it right here in this moment
[01:45.31] For you, I'd give the world, and you know it
[02:07.31] 
[01:55.66] In this game we're playing
[01:57.08] Only fact is what beats the fiction, baby
[01:59.69] So no delaying
[02:00.97] Make your move before they see through it
[02:21.47] 
[02:03.60] Reading between all the lines
[02:04.93] You'll know at first glance, your senses are enhanced
[02:07.31] So don't waste the chance to play your hand
[02:28.81] 
[02:10.01] 'Cause when your fate, it all weighs on your game sense
[02:13.58] You gotta make a choice between the dark and the light
[02:17.40] Your demons, you may meet, yeah, you may face defeat
[02:20.95] But not if you greet them with a fearless soul
[02:43.95] 
[02:26.25] Take a stand, clap your hands, and just do the best you can
[02:30.25] A worthwhile fighting style, you and me can go on as one
[02:34.25] Attention, don't you go alone, your luck, it's got limits
[03:02.75] 
[02:41.68] A detailed fairy tale, give it life and make it real
[02:45.32] It's a sweet victory, you'll never forget, come with me
[02:49.52] You ready? Throw away your doubt, there's nothing to fear now
[02:54.33] Take a step, and we'll move up the staircase
[03:16.33] 
[03:28.18] Every time you smile, it's like an angel's
[03:31.83] Every time I'm falling, your charming eyes meet mine
[03:35.60] Even now, I feel like I'm being drawn to you, oh
[03:59.60] 
[03:43.32] Do you feel the static between our heartbeats?
[03:47.03] Do you see the same future when you close your eyes?
[03:51.08] I don't even think that the world could stop us now, no
[04:18.58] 
[03:58.57] Do or die, golden time, lover's gonna blow your mind
[04:02.25] Raise the stakes, poker face, give me all you got, here we go
[04:06.59] Yeah, I know those delusions will drag you into it
[04:31.59] 
[04:13.73] It's the same endless game, but somehow I'll find my way
[04:17.58] It's a fine borderline, but I'll walk it still, what's the price
[04:21.57] Won't think twice, I will pay it right here in this moment, woah
[04:53.57] 
[04:29.05] Take a stand, clap your hands, and just do the best you can
[04:32.83] A worthwhile fighting style, you and me can go on as one
[04:37.25] Attention, don't you go alone, your luck, it's got limits
[05:05.75] 
[04:44.64] A detailed fairy tale, give it life and make it real
[04:48.40] It's a sweet victory, you'll never forget, come with me
[04:52.46] You ready? Throw away your doubt, there's nothing to fear now
