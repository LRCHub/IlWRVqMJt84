[00:23.13] No more hesitating
[00:24.79] But my body is shaking, not obeying
[00:27.39] Slowly decaying
[00:28.69] And my self-control - it is breaking
[00:31.16] Even the sun and the moon
[00:32.66] I can't count on them - My luck is all spent
[00:34.93] But this isn't the end
[00:36.25] I'm repeating those words again and again
[00:56.75] 
[00:46.14] They're poor odds I'm facing
[00:47.62] But you won't catch me fleeing, I'm not leaving
[00:50.27] Don't need a reason
[00:51.58] I know the future's ahead - let's seize it
[00:54.10] And it's a chance that I'm taking
[00:55.94] Eyes on the prize
[00:56.80] I'm not holding back
[00:58.07] Cause the pride of winning is all you need
[01:19.07] 
[01:00.66] I wanna dine on the sweet wine of victory
[01:04.27] But we may only get the stale taste of defeat
[01:08.17] But it's fine either way
[01:10.24] I'll take these threads of fate
[01:11.90] And I will create a new world of our own
[01:31.90] 
[01:17.33] Do or die, golden time lover's gonna blow your mind
[01:21.00] Raise the stakes - poker face
[01:23.02] Give me all you got, here we go
[01:25.23] Yeah, I know those illusions will drag you into it
[01:50.23] 
[01:32.54] It's the same, endless game
[01:34.44] But somehow I'll find my way
[01:36.41] It's a fine borderline
[01:38.26] But I'll walk it still
[01:39.68] What's the price - won't think twice
[01:41.36] I will pay it right here in this moment
[01:45.39] For you, I'd give the world, and you know it
[02:07.39] 
[01:55.57] In this game we're playing
[01:57.15] Only fact is what beats the fiction, baby
[01:59.58] So no delaying - Make your move
[02:01.74] Before they see through it
[02:03.52] Reading between all the lines
[02:05.12] You'll know at first glance, your senses are enhanced
[02:07.18] So don't waste the chance to play your hand
[02:09.97] 'Cause when your fate, it all weighs on your game sense
[02:13.64] You gotta make a choice between the dark and the light
[02:17.36] Your demons you may meet
[02:19.35] Yeah, you may face defeat
[02:21.04] But not if you greet them with a fearless soul
[02:44.04] 
[02:26.30] Take a stand - clap your hands
[02:28.27] And just do the best you can
[02:30.12] A worthwhile fighting style
[02:32.17] You and me can go on as one
[02:34.13] Attention! Don't ya go alone
[02:36.69] Your luck, it's got limits
[02:49.69] 
[02:41.92] A detailed fairy tale

[02:45.62] It's a sweet victory
[02:47.41] You'll never forget
[02:48.76] Come with me - you ready?
[02:50.56] Throw away your doubt there's nothing to fear now
[02:54.65] Take a step and we'll move up this staircase
[03:16.65] 
[03:28.11] Every time you smile, it's like an angel's
[03:31.87] Every time I'm falling, your charming eyes meet mine
[03:35.62] Even now I feel I'm being drawn to you
[03:43.49] Do you feel the static between our heartbeats?
[03:47.13] Do you see the same future when you close your eyes?
[03:51.02] I don't even think the world could stop us now
[04:14.02] 
[03:58.47] Do or die, golden time lover's gonna blow your mind
[04:02.39] Raise the stakes - poker face
